# Multi-agent-AI-Recruitment-Team :)

This Streamlit app is a sophisticated recruitment system that can take a candidate's resume, analyze their skills against job requirements, automatically schedule interviews for qualified candidates, and handle all the email communications - while recruiters just monitor the process through a simple dashboard.

When a recruiter uploads a candidate's resume, our system automatically evaluates their technical skills, sends personalized feedback emails, and for qualified candidates, even sets up Zoom interviews - all without manual intervention.

Our multi-agent recruitment system includes three agents: a Resume Analyzer, an Interview Scheduler, and an Email Communication agent.
